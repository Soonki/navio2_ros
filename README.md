# Navio2 ROS

## Who is this for?
This is a collection of messages and Python nodes to interface with Navio2. This is useful for wanting to skip ArduPilot and have ROS talk directly to Navio2 hardware.

## Currently Implemented
* RC IN
* RC Out

## To Be Implemented
* ADC
* GPS
* IMU
* AHRS
* LED

## To Use
Add this as a module in your ROS project.

## Cavets
At the time trying to get something put together quickly I copied the Navio2 interfaces into the project. It needs to be added as a git submodule or another setup.
